[] do not logout a "non remember me" user in an open browser (cookie session lifespan)
- create a authentication/isLoggedIn action and trigger that after the signIn AND after the checkIsLoggedIn
- capture that in a saga and register a simple "isLoggedIn" session cookie (use js-cookie)
- do not clear browser data inside checkIsLoggedIn if that cookie is set
[] check the user info and if the user is already logged in in the bg. Do not show the loader if we have auth info in the store

[] if remember me is not set, how can we log out the user when leaving?
