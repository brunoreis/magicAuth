[] decouple modules
[] find a way to inject the LoadingBranch only if the module is included
[] remove dependencies between users and authentication (by connecting the events with app/sagas)
[] remove dependencies between authentication and loading

[] create all global selectors in the same way as the authentication one (by passing the key)
[] create a naming pattern to name actions, storeProps, selectors and sagas. Review code. 

[] study runSagas and other resources and make the saga tests easier to write and readable.

[] test the pages
[] test the LoadingBranch component
[] run tests in the deploy

[] refactor redirects tests

[] add e2e tests (testCafe? Would that have to open my email client?)

[] move magic.link public key to Vercel
[] review the layout when the page reduce height

[] if remember me is not set, how can we log out the user (from magic) when closing the browser?

known issues

when two windows are opened with the /signUp, the user is able to register a username again on the second window. 
Since the usernames are in the store storage for now, this is expected because there will be a conflict between the persistors of both pages.
