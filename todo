[] send callback page to redirect after login
[] add internal loaders on login

[] add integration test to check the taken/available indicator on the SignUp page
[] add a few e2e tests (testCafe?)

[] add some kind of loading behaviour too
[] add pointer cursor to the buttons
[] add username validation to the email field
[] add email validation to the email field
[] review the layout when the page reduce height
